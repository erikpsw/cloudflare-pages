# WebSocketsServer Library Error Fix

You're encountering a compilation error in the WebSockets library. This is a common issue with newer versions of the ESP8266 core and the WebSockets library. Let me explain the problem and provide two solutions.

## The Problem

The error occurs because in newer versions of the ESP8266 core, the WiFiServer class changed its method name from `accept()` to `_accept()`, but the WebSocketsServer library is still trying to use the old method name.

## Solution 1: Use an Older Version of the WebSockets Library

1. In Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Manage Libraries
2. Find "WebSockets" by Markus Sattler
3. Click on the dropdown menu that shows the version number
4. Select version 2.3.5 instead of the latest version
5. Click Install/Update
